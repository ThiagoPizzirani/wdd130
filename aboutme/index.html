    <h3>More Information:</h3>
    <p>I love road trips, hopping in the car and driving to new places with the family. I like classical music or just calming music. I love Italian food (you can guess why based on my last name).</p>
    <p>When I am not studying, I try to do woodworking projects, build furniture or anything my wife wants me to create. It is very hard and there are lot of errors but when I finish, the feeling is great.</p>
    <p>I'm pursuing the BS in Technology but right now it is showing 7 years to finish - so I will be here for a while :) </p>
    <p>My plan is to change careers to build websites, apps and digital solutions for other companies. </p>
    <p>I grew up in Brazil but now I'm living in the United States. I have been a member my entire life and served in a lot of callings. I love the Gospel and to serve in His Church. </p>
